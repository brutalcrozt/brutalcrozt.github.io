Why You send me here again?<br>
Why not send me to hell directly?<br>
I am sick of this,<br>
haunted by an invisible unimaginable vision.<br>
Chased by a beautiful pain.<br>


My heart just colder than people know.<br>
They just can see my hand trembling<br>
when my faith was standing on a solid loneliness.<br>
My last hope just this is the day i can see Azrael.<br>
But why my only hope even cant end this?<br>
