Oh dear, why I dare to hurt you?<br>
This heart just to easy to expect,<br>
Too fragile standing by itself,<br>


I just draw every girl just pretty on the outside,<br>
But your beauty can't be drawn by that canvas.<br>


It just shackles my bone, an extraordinary pain.<br>
I can't begin to imagine how it will hurt you.<br>


I know I don't deserve forgiveness<br>
But please do forgive yourself, always.<br>
As always as your beauty cherish your soul.<br>


By yourself,<br>
I know that my heart and my eyes are cursed beyond redemption.<br>
Please don't fall or heaven will fall too.


By your faith,<br>
I know that no one in this world knows what love is.<br>
Except yourself.
