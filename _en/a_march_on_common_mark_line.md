<aim> explain what is common mark, a brief history on markdown
<listing> programming lang which already support [CommonMark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Well, its already sometimes (in years) my journey on programming field.
Somehow the moment that reaccuring on my mind is, when still on highschool i am editing a post
on [kaskus][link]. Driven by the desire so my post is appear nicely like any school text book.

Lovely, our [international QA site](https://stackexchange.com/) remind me of markdown, short summary of markdown [already written](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) by John Gruber. An opensource should be familiar using markdown. I like to say that
[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) is enhanced version of markdown and you can take alook the [spec](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec).
