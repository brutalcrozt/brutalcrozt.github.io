A person who admires software engineering and fall in love with the web.
But not a web developer enthusiast, but committed on software engineering. Interest in testing and automation.
Have experience with PHP (CodeIgniter), MySQL, and javascript.
I also have basic usage on java in 2018, using a servlet.
Outside of programming, I am interested in art, designing, and painting.
