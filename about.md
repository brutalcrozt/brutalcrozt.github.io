A person who admires software engineering and fall in love with the web.
Surely not web developer enthusiast, because my passion is on software engineering. Interest in testing and automation.
Have experience with PHP (CodeIgniter), MySQL, and javascript.
I also have basic usage on java in 2018, using a servlet.
Outside of programming, I am interested in art, designing.
